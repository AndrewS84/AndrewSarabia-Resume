        <div class="subheading mb-5">Accounting
        <p class="lead mb-4">Most people ask me why I chose accounting and I tell them a little story about myself. My uncle is an accountant for a big accounting firm and he makes very good money. He was in a way a role model for me and I looked up to him. I wanted to do what he did when I graduated from college. When I got to college I chose business as a major and from there I decided that I wanted to do accounting. Some people told me before I decided that I wanted to go into accounting. It is a very boring and tedious job. When I took Business 10 we covered all kinds of topics and even though I really enjoyed marketing I still wanted to go forward with accounting. I knew that it was going to take a lot of work and cost me many nights of sleep, but I felt like it would be worth it in the end. That is why I chose accounting as the thing that I wanted to do in life.<br><br> 

        I have also had a lot of experience with computers. When I was a teenager in high school I decided that I wanted to buy and build a pc. At the time I had a macbook, but I wanted to build a pc because there were more options in the programs and games. I really enjoyed playing video games at the time and there were certain games that I could not run or play on my macbook. When I got the money I ordered the parts for my pc and when all the parts finally arrived I started to build my pc. It was my first time building a pc so it basically took me all day to finish it. After hours I finally had my own pc. Building it was very satisfying because I did have anyone helping me. Building a pc taught me a lot about computers and all the parts that are required to function. I also know how to code a little which has been very helpful.<br><br>

        Now I am going to tell you a little more about myself and the kind of things that I like to do in my free time. I love sports and my favorites are definitely football and basketball. I am not the biggest fan of the NFL, but every saturday during football season I love to watch college football. I enjoy both the NBA and college basketball, but my favorite time of the year is March Madness. My favorite place to eat is definitely In-N-Out and Panda Express. Like I said earlier I love to play video games and my favorite ones are Call of Duty and CSGO. I ran track and cross country in high school which made me understand what it means to be a part of a team. I love to watch basketball, but I also love to play it. These are just a few things that I like to do, but there are many other things as well.<br><br>
